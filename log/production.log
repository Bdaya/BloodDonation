Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) ~.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): ~ ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: ~.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) login.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): login ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: login.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Summary:

Resolution:

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) admin.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): admin ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: admin.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) test.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): test ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: test.
Resolution:

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) siteadmin.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): siteadmin ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: siteadmin.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) portaladmin.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): portaladmin ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: portaladmin.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) adm.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): adm ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: adm.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) doxygen.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): doxygen ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: doxygen.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): nginx ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: nginx.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) %22ns%3D%22netsparker%280x000055%29).
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): %22ns%3D%22netsparker%280x000055%29) ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: %22ns%3D%22netsparker%280x000055%29).
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Request with id(s) new
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Summary:
  When calling Request.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): new
ns:netsparker056650=vuln ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: new
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 
ns:netsparker056650=vuln ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 538c9e768877f45aea000003
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 538c9e768877f45aea000003
ns:netsparker056650=vuln ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 538c9e768877f45aea000003
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) 538cb2348877f4a053000001
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 538cb2348877f4a053000001
ns:netsparker056650=vuln ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 538cb2348877f4a053000001
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) about.
Summary:

Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) sign_in
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): sign_in
ns:netsparker056650=vuln ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: sign_in
ns:netsparker056650=vuln.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) password.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): password ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: password.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class User with id(s) password.
Summary:
  When calling User.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): password ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: password.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
