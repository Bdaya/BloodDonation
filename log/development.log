Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::InvalidFind (
Problem:
  Calling Document.find with nil is invalid.
Summary:
  Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array of documents if multiple ids are provided.
Resolution:
  Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the key from which it is accessed is incorrect.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class BloodType with id(s) Select Blood type.
Summary:
  When calling BloodType.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): Select Blood type ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: Select Blood type.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class BloodType with id(s) Select Blood type.
Summary:
  When calling BloodType.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): Select Blood type ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: Select Blood type.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute (
Problem:
  Attempted to set a value for 'latitude' which is not allowed on the model Request.
Summary:
  Without including Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in your model and the attribute does not already exist in the attributes hash, attempting to call Request#latitude= for it is not allowed. This is also triggered by passing the attribute to any method that accepts an attributes hash, and is raised instead of getting a NoMethodError.
Resolution:
  You can include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic if you expect to be writing values for undefined fields often.):

Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute (
Problem:
  Attempted to set a value for 'latitude' which is not allowed on the model Request.
Summary:
  Without including Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in your model and the attribute does not already exist in the attributes hash, attempting to call Request#latitude= for it is not allowed. This is also triggered by passing the attribute to any method that accepts an attributes hash, and is raised instead of getting a NoMethodError.
Resolution:
  You can include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic if you expect to be writing values for undefined fields often.):

Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute (
Problem:
  Attempted to set a value for 'latitude' which is not allowed on the model Request.
Summary:
  Without including Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in your model and the attribute does not already exist in the attributes hash, attempting to call Request#latitude= for it is not allowed. This is also triggered by passing the attribute to any method that accepts an attributes hash, and is raised instead of getting a NoMethodError.
Resolution:
  You can include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic if you expect to be writing values for undefined fields often.):
